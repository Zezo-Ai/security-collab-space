# OpenJS Security Collaboration Space

Our objectives are to:

- Strengthen the security of OpenJS projects.  
- Provide maintainers with actionable guidance on security topics.  
- Foster collaboration among maintainers on security topics.    
- Connect JavaScript maintainers with the broader security community.
