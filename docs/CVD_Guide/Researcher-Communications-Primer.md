# Researcher Communications Primer

Proactively working to make a good impression in all communications with Reporters/Security Researchers is the key to your success. Each message is an opportunity to establish your Project's reputation in the security community and to potentially gain a recurring reporter that helps improve the security posture of your Project.

But be mindful of the negotiation-like dynamics that can occur between Bug Bounty and CVD Program operators and the security research community, particularly with high impact vulnerabilities.

#### Communicate with Empathy

Hostile and unprofessional behaviors by Program operators are far less common and egregious than they once were. However, disrepectful treatment continues to be a common experience for ethical security researchers working in good faith when disclosing security vulnerabilities.

Be mindful of these experiences and what others may - in good or bad faith - interpret as dismissiveness or a lack of urgency whenever making decisions and communicating those decisions with a security researcher.

#### Communicate with Situational Awareness

You may recieve with erroneous and irrelevant disclosures from hostile or publicity seeking individuals demanding recognition for their research.

The best defense against these actors is to explain your decisions clearly and include supporting facts in all communications and professionally requesting the same from them. If there is ever disagreement on the validity, severity/impact, or exploitability of a security vulnerability, leave nothing to assumption and explicitly state (and continue to re-state if mentioned in a previous comm) the data behind your rationale.

### Understanding Researcher Assertions on Severity and Impact

Researcher assertions on Impact and Scope may need to be adjusted for reasons beyond their control:

#### Researchers Don't Live Your Software Like You Do
Although there are exceptions, one should expect that researchers who submit security vulnerabilities to Bug Bounty and CVD Programs are not as knowledgable on the software they're testing as the software engineers who wrote it.

#### Bug Hunting is a Different Skill Set
The technical skills needed to be a successful bug hunter/pen tester do not fully overlap with those of software engineers building open source and enterprise software.

While it's more common for Reporters to over-state the impact of their vulnerability for the sake of higher bounties and self-promotion, it's also not uncommon for researchers to unknowingly understate and miss the true scope and impact of their vulnerability.
